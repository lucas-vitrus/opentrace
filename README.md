# TEST FORK OF Trace - A fork of AI-Powered PCB Design Suite

** TEST *** 
**Trace is a modified version of the KiCad EDA software, enhanced with AI-powered circuit design capabilities.**

> **Important:** Trace is based on [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/), an open-source electronics design automation suite. This is an independent fork created and maintained by the Trace team. Trace is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by the KiCad project or The Linux Foundation.

For specific documentation about [building Trace](https://docs.buildwithtrace.com/build/), policies and guidelines, and source code documentation see the [Trace Documentation](https://docs.buildwithtrace.com) website.

You may also take a look into the [Wiki](https://github.com/buildwithtrace/trace/wiki) and the [contribution guide](https://docs.buildwithtrace.com/contribute/).
