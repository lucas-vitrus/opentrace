Trace installation
==================

Trace is an AI-powered PCB design suite, forked from KiCad.

The parts of Trace
------------------

  Trace consists of 3 components:

  trace         - Trace programs and core files.
  trace-doc     - Documentation and interactive help (optional package).
  trace-library - Schematic symbol, PCB footprint, and 3D model libraries (optional package).

  This repository contains the source code for the main Trace programs. The documentation
  and library sources are available at https://github.com/buildwithtrace

  Note: Trace maintains compatibility with KiCad file formats.


Installation from binary packages
---------------------------------

  Check the Trace website for packages and installation instructions for
  all supported platforms: https://buildwithtrace.com/download/

  Data files (schematics, boards, libraries) are compatible with all platforms
  and are generally compatible with KiCad files.


Linux install tree
-------------------------------------

  The default locations Trace uses to install its components on Linux are:

  ${prefix}/bin                    - Binaries (executable files).
  ${prefix}/lib/trace              - Shared libraries.
  ${prefix}/share/doc/trace        - Various documentation.
  ${prefix}/share/doc/trace/help   - Interactive help.
  ${prefix}/share/trace/demos      - Sample schematics and printed boards.
  ${prefix}/share/trace/template   - Template projects and sheets.
  ${prefix}/share/trace/symbols    - Schematic symbol libraries.
  ${prefix}/share/trace/footprints - PCB footprint libraries.
  ${prefix}/share/trace/3dmodels   - 3D component models (.wrl and .step format).
  ${prefix}/share/trace/resources  - Resource files (images, etc).

  Warning:
  Do not change the Trace installation tree, or the location of binary files.  Otherwise
  Trace may not be able to find some or all of its required files.

Installation from source code
-----------------------------

  Current documentation for building from source can be found at: https://docs.buildwithtrace.com/build/

macOS install tree
------------------

  On macOS, the install tree is similar to Linux with some modifications for the app bundle structure.

Windows install tree
--------------------

  On Windows, the default installation is typically in:
  C:\Program Files\Trace\${version}\

  With the following structure:
  bin\              - Executable files and DLLs
  share\trace\      - Data files (same structure as Linux)
