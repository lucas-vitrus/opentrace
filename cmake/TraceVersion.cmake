# This file gets included in the WriteVersionHeader.cmake file to set
# the default Trace version when the source is provided in an archive
# file or git is not available on the build system.   When Trace is
# cloned using git, the git version can be used.  This version string should
# be set after each version tag is added to the git repo.  This will
# give developers a reasonable idea where which branch was used to build
# Trace.
#
# Note: This version string should follow the semantic versioning system
set( TRACE_SEMANTIC_VERSION "1.0.0" )

# Default the version to the semantic version.
# This can be overridden by the git repository tag though (if using git)
set( TRACE_VERSION "${TRACE_SEMANTIC_VERSION}" )
